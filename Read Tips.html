        <h2>5 Tips to Boost Your Productivity</h2>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>1. Prioritize Tasks with the Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The Eisenhower Matrix divides tasks into four categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important.</p>
            <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> By focusing on what is both urgent and important, you avoid wasting time on tasks that don’t contribute to your long-term goals. It helps you clearly identify what needs immediate attention and what can wait.</p>

            <h2>2. Break Tasks Into Smaller Steps</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Large tasks can feel overwhelming and discourage you from starting. Breaking them down into manageable steps makes them seem less daunting.</p>
            <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> It creates a sense of accomplishment as you complete each small task and keeps you motivated. It also helps prevent procrastination because you’ll have a clear plan to follow.</p>

            <h2>3. Eliminate Distractions</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Identify the common distractions in your work environment (like social media, noisy surroundings, or interruptions from others) and minimize them as much as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> Fewer distractions mean more focus. Use techniques like turning off notifications, using website blockers, or setting specific times to check emails or messages to stay focused on the task at hand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>4. Use Time Management Techniques (e.g., Pomodoro Technique)</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The Pomodoro Technique involves working in focused intervals (usually 25 minutes), followed by short breaks (5 minutes), with a longer break after several intervals.</p>
            <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> It helps maintain focus and mental energy by giving your brain time to rest. The technique creates a sense of urgency to complete tasks, and regular breaks prevent burnout.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>5. Set Clear and Specific Goals</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Clearly define what you want to achieve, both short-term and long-term. Set measurable and time-bound goals so you know exactly what success looks like.</p>
            <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> Having clear goals keeps you motivated and ensures that you're working toward something meaningful. It also helps you stay on track and prioritize what’s most important.</p>
